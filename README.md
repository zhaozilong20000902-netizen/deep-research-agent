# Deep Research Agent

Multi-agent deep research assistant with human-in-the-loop sub-question confirmation, web search, academic search, iterative report generation, and project-based version management. Built on the OpenAI Agents SDK and deployed on EdgeOne Makers.

**Framework:** OpenAI Agents SDK · **Category:** Research · **Language:** TypeScript

[![Deploy to EdgeOne Makers](https://cdnstatic.tencentcs.com/edgeone/pages/deploy.svg)](https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?template=deep-research-edgeone&from=within&fromAgent=1&agentLang=typescript)

## Overview

This template runs a structured research pipeline that breaks a user question into sub-questions, gathers evidence from both the open web and academic databases, and synthesizes a cited research report. A follow-up chat mode lets users discuss and refine completed reports without re-running searches.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Decomposition** — The agent first breaks the research question into sub-questions and waits for user confirmation before proceeding.
- **Dual-Source Research** — Parallel web search (Tencent Cloud Web Search API) and academic search (CrossRef + Semantic Scholar) with URL scraping for detailed content.
- **Iterative Report Generation** — A synthesizer agent produces the final report with inline citations; a cleanup stage validates citation formatting.
- **Project Version Management** — Research reports are saved per-project with version history, diffing, and rollback support.
- **Follow-Up Chat** — A lightweight conversational endpoint answers questions about an existing report and can trigger regeneration.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Yes | Model gateway API key. Use your Makers Models API Key, or any OpenAI-compatible provider key. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` | Yes | Gateway base URL. For Makers Models, use `https://ai-gateway.edgeone.link/v1`. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL` | No | Model ID. Defaults to `@makers/deepseek-v4-flash`. |
| `WSA_API_KEY` | No | Tencent Cloud Web Search API (WSA) key for the platform's built-in `web_search` tool. Without it, web search falls back to a less reliable path. |

This template follows the OpenAI-compatible standard — point these at Makers Models or any compatible provider.

### How to get AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY

1. Open the Makers Console (https://edgeone.ai/makers/new?s_url=https://console.tencentcloud.com/edgeone/makers)
2. Sign in and enable Makers
3. Go to Makers → Models → API Key and create a key
4. Copy it into `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

> Built-in models are free within quota and great for validation. For production, bind your own paid provider key (BYOK).

### How to get WSA_API_KEY

1. Enable Web Search (WSA) in the Tencent Cloud WSA Console (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/wsapi/index)
2. Obtain the API Key and set it as `WSA_API_KEY`
3. Reference: [WSA API Documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1806/130615)

> If you do not use Tencent Cloud WSA, the `web_search` tool implementation can be replaced with a third-party search service (e.g. Exa, Tavily).

## Local Development

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+
- EdgeOne CLI (`npm i -g edgeone`)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY, AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL, and WSA_API_KEY
edgeone makers dev
```

Open the local observability dashboard at http://localhost:8088/agent-metrics.

Files prefixed with `_` are private modules — not exposed as public routes.

## How It Works

### Runtime Mode
Files under `agents/` run in **session mode**: requests with the same `conversation_id` are sticky-routed to the same agent instance and the same sandbox. This ensures conversation history and uploaded context persist across follow-up messages.

### End-to-End Workflow

1. **Question input** — The frontend POSTs `/research` with the research question, depth level, and optional project ID.
2. **Sub-question decomposition** — A decomposer agent breaks the question into focused sub-questions (2–7 depending on depth). The frontend presents these for user confirmation.
3. **User confirmation** — The user edits or confirms the sub-questions. The frontend then POSTs `/research` again with `confirmedSubQuestions` to enter full research mode.
4. **Parallel research** — The research agent spawns parallel tool calls:
   - **Web search** (`search_web`) via the platform's `web_search` tool (Tencent Cloud WSA).
   - **Academic search** (`search_literature`) via CrossRef and Semantic Scholar APIs.
5. **URL scraping** — Key URLs from web search results are scraped for detailed content using the platform `browser_fetch` tool.
6. **Report synthesis** — A synthesizer agent combines all sources into a structured research report with inline citations.
7. **Cleanup & validation** — The report passes through post-processing (preamble stripping, citation validation, structure cleanup).
8. **Persistence** — The final report is saved as a project version via `cloud-functions/project/`.
9. **Follow-up chat** — Users can POST `/chat` with an existing report to ask questions or request edits without re-running searches.

### Key Routes & Parameters
- `/research` — Main research endpoint. Body: `{ question, depth, projectId, confirmedSubQuestions?, decomposeOnly? }`.
- `/chat` — Follow-up discussion about a completed report. Body: `{ message, projectId, chatHistory, report }`.
- `/stop` — Aborts the active research run. Body: `{ conversation_id }`.
- `/health` — Liveness probe (lives in `cloud-functions/`, not AI-related).
- `conversation_id` is generated client-side and forwarded via the `makers-conversation-id` header; the runtime auto-binds it to `context.conversation_id`.

### Timeouts
Agent timeout is set to **300 seconds** in `edgeone.json` to accommodate long-running research synthesis.
